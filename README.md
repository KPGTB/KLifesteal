**KLifesteal** is an advanced & modern **LifeSteal-style** plugin. It contains **custom lives UI** (above hunger bar) and 4 items with **custom textures**. The mechanic is simple - if you kill a player, you will get the next life, but if you death, you lose one. If your hearts drop to 0, you will be **banned**. Players are dropping **souls** that can be used to **revive another player** (revive totem) or to **get more HP** (compressed soul & additional heart).
